### 3. Stroke Prediction Using Healthcare Data
**File:** `LabAssignment3.ipynb`

- **Description:** A machine learning project analyzing healthcare data to predict the likelihood of strokes using various classification and regression algorithms.
- **Algorithms Used:**
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Linear Regression
- **Highlights:**
  - Utilized healthcare datasets for predictive analysis.
  - Focused on feature selection, model evaluation, and accuracy improvement.
